# De-Bug: Insect Species Identification Using CNN

## Introduction
Welcome to the "De-Bug" project! We use machine learning to identify insect species from images, addressing a common challenge in ecological researchâ€”taxonomy. Taxonomy, particularly within families of visually similar insect species, can be laborious and time-consuming. By developing a neural network that can efficiently recognize insect species, we aim to streamline species detection.

## The Challenge
Taxonomical classification of closely related species often requires careful examination of physical attributes by experts, a process that is both tedious and time-consuming, especially for insect families with similar appearances. Our project leverages a dataset from the Natural History Museum London, which includes over 63,364 images of 291 different insect species, to automate the classification process using a machine learning model.

## Our Data
The dataset used is publicly available from the Natural History Museum London, organized into folders named after each species' GBIF ID number. Each folder contains multiple cropped images of different specimens, providing a robust basis for our machine learning tasks.
